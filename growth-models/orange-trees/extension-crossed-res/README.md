Adds a "day effect" following Millar (2004, Aust NZ J. Stat, 46, p. 543-554)

The following example was considered by Millar (2004, Aust NZ J. Stat, 46, p. 543-554). A "day effect" (_v_) was added to the original model formulation, yielding

where _u_ is a tree-effect and _v_ is a day-effect. This is an example of a model where the random effects _u_ and _v_ are crossed. Millar (2004) used simulated likelihood to evaluate the marginal likelihood.
