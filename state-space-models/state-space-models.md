#  State-space models

[A discrete valued time series model; Polio data][1]
:  Illustrate how a time series of count data can be modelled as a GLMM with a Poisson response

[Stochastic volatility models for financial time series][2]
:  Stochastic volatility models are used in mathematical finance to describe the evolution of asset returns, which typically exhibit changing variances over time.

[Delta smelt life cycle model ][3]
:  A state-space multistage model to evaluate population impacts in the presence of density dependence.

[Skate mortality: Bayesian state-space model][4]
:  Bayesian state-space model example from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group

[Theta-logistic population growth model][5]
:  State-space model from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group
