#  Delta smelt life cycle model

Filed under:  [State space model][1], [Fisheries][2], [Ecology][3], [Random effect][4]

A state-space multistage model to evaluate population impacts in the presence of density dependence

This is the state-space approach reported in [Maunder and Deriso (2011)][5]Â to evaluate delta smelt population impacts in the presence of density dependence. Mark Maunder's notes on the implementation of the model in ADMB-RE along with an example .tpl are included below.
