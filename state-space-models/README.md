# State-space models

* [A discrete valued time series model; Polio data][1]
Illustrate how a time series of count data can be modelled as a GLMM with a Poisson response

* [Stochastic volatility models for financial time series][2]
Stochastic volatility models are used in mathematical finance to describe the evolution of asset returns, which typically exhibit changing variances over time.

* [Delta smelt life cycle model][3]
A state-space multistage model to evaluate population impacts in the presence of density dependence.

* [Skate mortality: Bayesian state-space model][4]
Bayesian state-space model example from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group

* [Theta-logistic population growth model][5]
State-space model from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group
