#  Wood (2006) parameterization

Filed under:  [Splines][1]

The following example shows how the parameterization of the smoothing spline, based on eigen decomposition, can be implemented in ADMB. Comparison is made to R/gmcv. An advantage offered by ADMB is that uncertainty in the smoothing parameter is incorporated into the uncertainty of the GAM fit.
