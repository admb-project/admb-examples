#  Count data

Filed under: [Generalized Linear Mixed Models][6]

Poisson, negative binomial counts in various variants

[A discrete valued time series model; Polio data][1]
:  Illustrate how a time series of count data can be modelled as a GLMM with a Poisson response

[Negative binomial serially correlated counts][2]
:  Compares a negative binomial response to Poisson responses for the polio data

[Negative Binomial Fir Fecundity][3]
:

[Flexible negative binomial][4]
:  Explores non-standard relationships between mean and variance in the NB model

[Owl nestling negotiation][5]
:  Zero-inflated generalized linear mixed model example from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group.
