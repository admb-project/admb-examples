These data are from E. Crone and colleagues' long-term study of stages, flowering, and seed pod production of Astragulus scaphoides. The model looks at individual flowering as a function of the previous year's stage and seed production.

 

This is a binomial generalized linear mixed model for flowering probability with three random effects: intercept and effect of size across individuals and intercept variation across years.
