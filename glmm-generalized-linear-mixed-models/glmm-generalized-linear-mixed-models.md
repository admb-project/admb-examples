#  GLM/GLMM/GAM

[GAMs as mixed models][1]
:  Generalized Additive Models

[Non Gaussian random effects][2]
:  ADMB allows non-Gaussian random effects via transformation of a normal variate

[Count data][3]
:  Poisson, negative binomial counts in various variants

[Mixed response][4]
:  Models with responses of different types

[Gaussian models][5]
:  Models where both the response and latent random variable are Gaussian. For such models the covariance matrix of the observations can be worked out analytically, but still the latent variable (random effect) formulation can be beneficial.
