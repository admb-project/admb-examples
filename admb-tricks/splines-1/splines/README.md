[splines.tpl][2]

[Example results][3]
:  notes: grey lines are from MCMC samples, third derivative looks rough only because of numerical precision

[splines.dat][4]
:  data file to go with the model in splines.tpl

[R code][5]
:  read output from splines model and plot results shown in spline_example.pdf
