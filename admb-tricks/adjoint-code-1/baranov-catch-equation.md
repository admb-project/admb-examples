#  Baranov catch equation

Filed under: [Fisheries][1], [Adjoint Code][2]

Example by Steven Martell of writing adjoint code in ADMB to numerically solve the Baranov catch equation. A simple simulation model is used to generate simulated catch and relative abundance data with observation error only. The assessment model is then conditioned on the simulated catch data.
