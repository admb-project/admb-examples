[Mark-Recapture random effects model][1]

[Estimation of detection function ][2]
:  Illustrates the likelihood based estimation of the detection function (perpendicular distance) in line transect surveys

[Delta smelt life cycle model ][3]
:  A state-space multistage model to evaluate population impacts in the presence of density dependence

[Theta-logistic population growth model][4]
:  State-space model from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group
