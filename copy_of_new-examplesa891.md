#  All examples

All examples currently available in the website

[Math][1]
:  Various undocumented techniques and tricks useful for developing ADMB programs

[MCMCMC][2]
:  This presents generalized code for conducting Metropolis Coupled MCMC using ADMB called within R

[Mean and variance][3]
:  Both mean and variance vary smoothly as functions of a covariate

[MGRF: simple CAR model][4]
:  CAR model for the Scottish Lip Cancer Data

[Mineralization of terbuthylazine][5]
:  A simple nonlinear least-squares problem, with normally distributed residuals and no random effects or latent variables. Example from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group.

[Miscellaneous][6]
:  Stuff that is hard to categorize, but still is useful

[Mixed response][7]
:  Models with responses of different types

[Negative Binomial Fir Fecundity][8]
:

[Negative binomial serially correlated counts][9]
:  Compares a negative binomial response to Poisson responses for the polio data

[Non Gaussian random effects][10]
:  ADMB allows non-Gaussian random effects via transformation of a normal variate

[Occupancy model][11]
:  Comparison of ADMB and WinBUGS modelling approach for simple occupancy model. This is also a comparison of Bayesian and frequentist modelling.

[One-compartment open model][12]
:  Fit mixed effects model to the classical "phenopharbital" model

[Orange trees][13]
[Ordered categorical responses][14]
:  Ordered categorical responses with application to SOCATT data

[Owl nestling negotiation][15]
:  Zero-inflated generalized linear mixed model example from the NCEAS non-linear modelling working group.

[Parameter scaling][16]
:  Shows how to scale parameters so that they become of the same magnitude

[Parameterization][17]
:  Examples of how to (and not to) parameterize mathematical functions and statistical models

[Pella-Tomlinson basic model][18]
:  Pella-Tomlinson by Arni Magnusson with user interface and formatted MCMC output. Repeats and extends the analysis of Polacheck et al. (1993).

[Pella-Tomlinson from ADMB manual][19]
:  Pella-Tomlinson example by Dave Fournier from the ADMB manual. Demonstrates several innovative modelling approaches: 6 month time step, time-varying K and q.

[PK/DK ][20]
:  Pharmacokinetics (PK) & Pharmacodynamics(DK)
