#  Fitting Cormack-Jolly-Seber Models to Capture-Recapture Data using R2admb

Filed under:  [Mark software][1], [CJS model][2], [Mark-recapture][3]

This example provides a template to fit any fixed effects CJS model to capture-recapture data.  This template and code to create the .DAT file are used in the R package marked (_<https://github.com/jlaake/marked>_) when use.admb is TRUE. The pdf shows an example with the dipper data that is also analyzed with MARK (_<http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/>_)  through the RMark package (**cran**.[_r-project.org/web/packages/_][4]**RMark**/index.html) to show that the same results are obtained.
