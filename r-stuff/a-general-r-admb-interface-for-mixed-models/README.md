#  R - ADMB interface for mixed models

Explains the interface between R and ADMB used in the R package glmmADMB. Can be used as building block for other models.

A simple example that shows how you can create a general .tpl file and use R to construct the necessary data structures from a formula and data frame for random or mixed effect models. The example we construct is for mixed effects logistic regression but it can be modified as you wish. It is the approach that we are trying to illustrate rather than the particular example.
