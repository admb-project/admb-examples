#  PDK

Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are important in Pharmacokinetics (PK) & Pharmacodynamics(DK) and can be fit in ADMB.

The difference between PK and DK has been described (Wikipedia) as

> _"Pharmacokinetics may be simply defined as what the body does to the drug, as opposed to pharmacodynamics which may be defined as what the drug does to the body"_

Se more details at <http/en.wikipedia.orwikPharmacokinetics> and <http/en.wikipedia.orwikPharmacodynamics>.

 

I nice description of mixed models in PDK is provided here: <http/www4.stat.ncsu.ed~davidiawebinar.pdf>

 

The reason ADMB is useful for such models are:

1. The flexibility of ADMB allows numerical ODE schemes to be implemented.
2. Robust and fast parameter estimation.
3. Mixed mode functionality
