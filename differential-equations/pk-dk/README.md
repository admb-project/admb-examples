#  PK/DK

Filed under: [Differential Equations][2]

Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are important in Pharmacokinetics (PK) & Pharmacodynamics(DK) and can be fit in ADMB.

The difference between PK and DK has been described (Wikipedia) as

> _"Pharmacokinetics may be simply defined as what the body does to the drug, as opposed to pharmacodynamics which may be defined as what the drug does to the body"_

Se more details at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics.

 

I nice description of mixed models in PK/DK is provided here: http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~davidian/webinar.pdf


The reason ADMB is useful for such models are:

1. The flexibility of ADMB allows numerical ODE schemes to be implemented.
2. Robust and fast parameter estimation.
3. Mixed mode functionality
