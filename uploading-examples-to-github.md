#  Uploading examples to github

_<https://github.com/>_ is a good (free for our purpose) option for uploading your ADMB examples to the web. A link from the ADMB webpage will than direct users to your github stuff. This allows you to easily to modify your example without having write access to the ADMB web page.

**Note **Files like pdf's should be put in the download section and only text files like tpl and dat as repository files.  The reason is that if you include a non-text file in repository any changes cause the file to be re-copied entirely if it is changed.  In the download section, you delete it and upload again.
