#  Baranov catch equation

Filed under:  [Fisheries][1]

Writing adjoint code in ADMB to numerically solve the Baranov catch equation.

A simple simulation model (contributed by Steve Martell) is used to generate simulated catch and relative abundance data with observation error only. The assessment model is then conditioned on the simulated catch data. Documentation and .tpl files are provided below:
